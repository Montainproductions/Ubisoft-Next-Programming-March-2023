# Ubisoft-Next-Programming-March-2023
 
## Intro
Earlier this year, I competed in the Ubisoft Next programming competition. Even though I only progressed a little into the future rounds, I found the entire experience entertaining and a good way of testing my expertise. I have complete code documentation in a pdf format named "ReadMe - Documentation" if you are interested in my thought process and decisions on the different programming choices I made for the project.
